# Project Status Report

## Pre-task checklist
- Identify key UI pages/components and flows from code
- Review API routes for functionality
- Trace authentication and session persistence approach
- Confirm presence/absence of email verification
- Check for any database connections/libraries
- Verify per-user session history capture and display

---

## Frontend

- Stack and structure
  - Next.js pages: `index.tsx` (landing + auth modal), `home.tsx` (dashboard), `drill.tsx` (pose drill), `account.tsx`, `profile.tsx`, `_app.tsx` (session hydration/routing).
  - Components: `Layout.tsx`, `RequireAuth.tsx`, `sessions/SessionHistory.tsx`, Zustand stores `authStore.ts`, `usePoseStore.ts`.
  - Tailwind for styling. MediaPipe libs are lazy-loaded on `drill.tsx`.

- Behavior
  - Client-side login/signup modal on landing (no server calls).
  - Authenticated routes are gated by `RequireAuth`.
  - `_app.tsx` persists a minimal session `{ email, token }` to `localStorage` and restores it; redirects to `/home` after auth.
  - `Home`/`Account` display insights and a session history table.

- Strengths
  - Clean, responsive layout and clear auth gating.
  - Smooth session UX with redirect ergonomics.
  - Rich session visualization (expandable rows, filter low quality).

- Issues/risks
  - Entirely client-side state; no SSR-backed auth or data.
  - User registry and session history are in-memory; non-demo users do not survive a full reload.

Validation: UI pages, state stores, routing, and UX patterns covered; key strengths and limitations identified.

## Backend

- API routes present and functional
  - Auth suite: signup, login, logout, refresh, verify-email, resend-verification
  - Sessions: start, finish (POST /api/sessions/[sessionId]), list, detail
  - Health: uptime + memory + DB connectivity
  - Admin: init-db to ensure indexes/TTL

- Summary
  - Server-backed auth and session persistence to MongoDB are implemented.
  - Email verification via Resend is wired.

---

## Authentication

- Implementation
  - Server-backed: bcrypt password hashing, JWT access tokens, rotating refresh cookies.
  - Email verification flow; unverified users blocked from session endpoints.
  - Client keeps access token in localStorage (for Authorization header) and relies on refresh cookie.

- Guards and flows
  - `RequireAuth.tsx` protects routes. Server middleware enforces verified email for session APIs.

---

## Email Verification

- Status
  - No email libraries or verification routes/UI in code.

- Conclusion
  - Not implemented.

Validation: Absence of code-level email verification confirmed.

---

## Database Connection

- MongoDB Atlas via native driver; global client reused in serverless functions.
- Collections: users, sessions, auditLogs; TTL index on sessions.createdAt (~90 days).

---

## Session History (per-user)

- Implementation
  - `SessionTracker` stores raw events in-memory only and computes an aggregated v2 `SessionReport` at finalize.
  - `drill.tsx` posts { schemaVersion:2, report, summary } to the finish endpoint.
  - `SessionHistory` prefers `report` and falls back to legacy fields.

- Strengths
  - Aggregated-only persistence avoids sensitive raw data; UI stays backward-compatible.

---

## Coverage confirmation
- Frontend: described and validated
- Backend: described and validated
- Authentication: described and validated
- Email Verification: described and validated (not implemented)
- Database Connection: described and validated (not implemented)
- Session History: described and validated

If helpful, next steps could include: minimal auth API with hashed passwords, email verification flow, Mongo/Prisma persistence for users and session records, and scoping history queries by user id.
