# Project Status Report

## Pre-task checklist
- Identify key UI pages/components and flows from code
- Review API routes for functionality
- Trace authentication and session persistence approach
- Confirm presence/absence of email verification
- Check for any database connections/libraries
- Verify per-user session history capture and display

---

## Frontend

- Stack and structure
  - Next.js pages: `index.tsx` (landing + auth modal), `home.tsx` (dashboard), `drill.tsx` (pose drill), `account.tsx`, `profile.tsx`, `_app.tsx` (session hydration/routing).
  - Components: `Layout.tsx`, `RequireAuth.tsx`, `sessions/SessionHistory.tsx`, Zustand stores `authStore.ts`, `usePoseStore.ts`.
  - Tailwind for styling. MediaPipe libs are lazy-loaded on `drill.tsx`.

- Behavior
  - Client-side login/signup modal on landing (no server calls).
  - Authenticated routes are gated by `RequireAuth`.
  - `_app.tsx` persists a minimal session `{ email, token }` to `localStorage` and restores it; redirects to `/home` after auth.
  - `Home`/`Account` display insights and a session history table.

- Strengths
  - Clean, responsive layout and clear auth gating.
  - Smooth session UX with redirect ergonomics.
  - Rich session visualization (expandable rows, filter low quality).

- Issues/risks
  - Entirely client-side state; no SSR-backed auth or data.
  - User registry and session history are in-memory; non-demo users do not survive a full reload.

Validation: UI pages, state stores, routing, and UX patterns covered; key strengths and limitations identified.

---

## Backend

- API routes present
  - `pages/api/health.ts`: Working GET health endpoint with uptime and memory details.
  - `pages/api/session-metrics.ts`: Stub returns schema version and example report; no persistence.

- Missing
  - No auth/profile endpoints; no metrics persistence endpoints; no email endpoints.

- Strengths
  - Health endpoint suitable for basic monitoring.

- Issues/risks
  - Core backend features (auth, verification, persistence) are not implemented.

Validation: Existing API routes enumerated; lack of functional business endpoints confirmed.

---

## Authentication

- Implementation
  - `components/authStore.ts` (Zustand) maintains:
    - In-memory users (seeded with Demo User) with plaintext passwords.
    - `signup`, `login`, `logout`, `updateProfile`; generates a random token.
    - Persists `{ email, token }` to `localStorage`; `hydrateSession(email, token)` accepts any token if user exists.

- Guards and flows
  - `RequireAuth.tsx` redirects to `/` when unauthenticated.
  - `_app.tsx` rehydrates from `localStorage` and handles redirects after explicit auth events.

- Strengths
  - Simple client-only demo flow with good redirect behavior.

- Issues/risks
  - No hashing/JWT/NextAuth; token not validated; plaintext passwords.
  - Users exist only in memory; signups are lost on hard reload.
  - No server-side session checks; spoofable via devtools.

Validation: Auth flow, persistence, and security posture described; main concerns called out.

---

## Email Verification

- Status
  - No email libraries or verification routes/UI in code.

- Conclusion
  - Not implemented.

Validation: Absence of code-level email verification confirmed.

---

## Database Connection

- Status
  - No database dependencies or usage found; no env-based DB config.
  - All data is client memory; only a minimal auth tuple is persisted in `localStorage`.

- Conclusion
  - Not implemented.

Validation: Verified via `package.json` and repository sources.

---

## Session History (per-user)

- Implementation
  - `usePoseStore.ts` tracks simple summaries and detailed `SessionRecord[]` via `SessionTracker` (`lib/metrics/SessionTracker.ts`).
  - `SessionTracker` computes KPIs/flags and builds a structured `report` via `lib/metrics/report.ts` at finalize.
  - `drill.tsx` starts tracking with `startSessionTracking(currentUser.email, ...)` and finalizes on session end.
  - `components/sessions/SessionHistory.tsx` renders a table with expand/collapse and a "Hide Low Quality" filter.

- Strengths
  - Rich, well-structured data model and computed report JSON.
  - Clear UI for history exploration and trends.

- Issues/risks
  - In-memory only; data lost on reload.
  - History array is not filtered by `userId` in the UI, so multiple users in one runtime could see mixed records.

Validation: Data flow from tracking to UI verified; gaps (persistence, per-user scoping) identified.

## Coverage confirmation
- Frontend: described and validated
- Backend: described and validated
- Authentication: described and validated
- Email Verification: described and validated (not implemented)
- Database Connection: described and validated (not implemented)
- Session History: described and validated

If helpful, next steps could include: minimal auth API with hashed passwords, email verification flow, Mongo/Prisma persistence for users and session records, and scoping history queries by user id.
